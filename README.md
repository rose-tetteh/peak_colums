# peak_colums
Peak columns lab on proficiency in manipulating multidimensional arrays, string formatting techniques and ability to control user input.

# Goal
- Search a given matrix for elements(Peak Columns) that are both a maximum in their row and a minimum in their column. 
- Display the positions and values of all peak-columns found.
- Proper use of functions or methods for modularization

# Functionalities
- Take user inputs
- Validate datatypes
- Handles invalid input gracefully (e.g., non-numeric input)

SAMPLE INPUT \
Matrix A: 3,3 \
 12  2  4 \
 17 10  1 \
 92 80 79 

SAMPLE OUTPUT \
(1,1) = 12
